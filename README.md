# Customer-churn-prediction-and-retention-analysis
The goal of this project is to analyze customer behavior, identify key churn drivers, and build a predictive model to help business stakeholders retain customers effectively.

## Problem Statement 

A company is experiencing a decline in revenue due to a high rate of customer churn, the phenomenon where customers stop using the company’s products or services. This poses a significant threat to the company’s growth and profitability. The company seeks to understand why customers are leaving and to identify actionable strategies to retain valuable customers. By analyzing historical customer data and predicting which customers are at risk of churn, the company aims to reduce churn, improve customer retention, and increase overall profitability.
